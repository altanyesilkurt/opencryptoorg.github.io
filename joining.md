            Anyone can join COPA, regardless whether you have patents, for free. Review the  <a href="/agreements/COPAMembershipAgreement.pdf" target="_blank" class="cp-hyperlink-dark">COPA Membership Agreement</a>, and contact membership at opencrypto dot org to sign.
  - title: Membership Agreement
    content: > 
            The COPA Membership Agreement is entered into by COPA members to address the threat of patents being used to stifle innovation
            and growth in cryptocurrency. Joining COPA means you are protected from patent suits initiated by other COPA members, 
            and you are part of a defensive community that works together to conquer common challenges so we can make excellent technology and products.
            <br>
            <br>Patent Pledge<br><br>
            Members agree to never assert their foundational crypto patents offensively against anyone, except under the following limited
            set of situations: (1) in self defense (if the member gets sued by a patent aggressor and the member wants to use its patents
            defensively against such an aggressor); (2) in defense of the community (if anyone else in the crypto community is attacked by a
            patent aggressor and the member wants to use its patents against such an aggressor); or (3) in defense against an impersonator
            who causes harm to the member’s customers (e.g., a copycat scammer of the member’s products). Members accomplish this by granting
            a non-exclusive and perpetual license to their foundational crypto patents, subject to the exceptions above.<br><br>
